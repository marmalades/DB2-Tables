# What is this?
This is a DB2 table creation and manipulation assignment. 

I am creating 9 different tables and then running 6 queries on the tables.

# What is this running off of?
This is using DB2 on IBM's z/OS Mainframe.


# Project Overview
The ERD.pdf file holds the tables and their relationships and offers a nice overview of the tables and their relationships. The ERD.pdf file provides the primary/foreign keys as well as table and attribute names.

# - In Progress - 
This project is still in progress and is incomplete. I will be adding the necessary table information and code as I finish it up on the Mainframe. 

TODO: Create a z/OS to git tool?
