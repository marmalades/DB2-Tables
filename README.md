# What is this?
This is a DB2 table creation and manipulation project. 

I am creating 9 different tables and then running 6 queries on the tables.

## What is this running off of?
This is using DB2 on IBM's z/OS Mainframe.

# Project Overview
All of the tables and their code are in the "Tables" folder. The The ERD.pdf file holds the tables and their relationships and offers a nice overview of the tables and their relationships. The ERD.pdf file provides the primary/foreign keys as well as table and attribute names.
